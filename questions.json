Consolidate all logs on a SIEM, and \nG. Enable time-of-day restrictions on  \nthe authentication server\nAdding location-based policies will prevent direct data access from outside \nof the country.

An email with a link from a server not under the \ncontrol of the company could be an email sent by the IT department as \npart of a phishing campaign.\nThe incorrect answers:\nA. Watering hole attack\nA watering hole attack is used as an alternative to attacking a victim's \ndevice directly. With a watering hole attack, an attacker will compromise a \nsite used by the victim and will simply wait for the victim to visit.\nB. Cross-site scripting\nCross-site scripting takes advantage of the trust already existing in a \nweb browser. In this example, there's no evidence of a vulnerable web \napplication or a specific browser-based vulnerability.\nC.

Create a separate daily backup archive for all\napplicable tax records\nAn important consideration for a data retention mandate is to always have \naccess to the information over the proposed time frame. In this example, \na daily backup would ensure tax information is constantly archived over \na seven year period and could always be retrieved if needed. If data was \ninadvertently deleted from the primary storage, the backup would still \nmaintain a copy.\nThe incorrect answers:\nA. Automate a script to remove all tax information more than  \nseven years old \nThe requirement is to maintain data for at least seven years, but there’s no \nrequirement to remove that data after that time frame. For example, some \nfinancial information may need to be retained well beyond the seven year \nmandate.\nB. Print and store all tax records in a seven-year cycle\nPaper has its place, but creating physical output of tax records and storing \nthem for seven years would include a significant cost in time, materials, \nand inventory space.

Which of the following should be used to gather this \ninformation?\n ❍A. Application log\n ❍B. Metadata\n ❍C. IPS log\n ❍D. Windows log\nThe Answer: C. IPS log\nAn IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) commonly uses a database of \nknown vulnerabilities to identify and block malicious network traffic. This \nlog of attempted exploits would provide the required report information.\nThe incorrect answers:\nA. Application log\nAn application log provides a summary of internal application functions \nand procedures. An application log would not commonly identify and log \nsecurity events.\nB. Metadata\nMetadata is a summary of information attached to a file or document. \nMetadata does not commonly store security events and would not be a \nvalid source for this reporting data.\nD. Windows log\nThe Windows Event Viewer shows the logs for the applications, security, \nand other aspects of the Windows operating system. An operating system \nlog would not commonly gather information on network-based attacks.\nMore information:\nSY0-701, Objective 4.9 - Log Data https://professormesser.link/701040901"

        "question": "C78. A system administrator has configured MAC filtering on their corporate \naccess point, but access logs show unauthorized users accessing the \nnetwork. Which of the following should the administrator configure to \nprevent future unauthorized use?",
        "options": [
            "Enable WPA3 encryption",
            "Remove unauthorized MAC addresses from the filter",

            "Modify the channel frequencies"
        ],
        "answer": "Enable WPA3 encryption",
        "explanation": "A. Enable WPA3 encryption\nA MAC (Media Access Control) address can be spoofed on a remote \ndevice, which means anyone within the vicinity of the access point can \nview and use legitimate MAC addresses. To ensure proper authentication, \nthe system administrator can enable WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access \nversion 3) with a pre-shared key or 802.1X can be used to integrate with \nan existing authentication database.\nThe incorrect answers:\nB. Remove unauthorized MAC addresses from the filter \nSince MAC addresses are visible when capturing packets, any \nunauthorized users affected by the removal of a MAC address would \nsimply view the remaining MAC addresses in use and spoof those \naddresses to gain access.\nC. Modify the SSID name\nThe SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name associated with the wireless \nnetwork. The name of the access point is not a security feature, so changing \nthe name would not provide any additional access control. \nD. Modify the channel frequencies\nThe frequencies used by the access point are chosen to minimize \ninterference with other nearby wireless devices. These wireless channels \nare not security features and changing the frequency would not limit \nunauthorized access.\nMore information:\nSY0-701, Objective 4.1 - Wireless Security Settings https://professormesser.link/701040104"
